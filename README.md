Hi, I'm **Makio**. I'm Italian, born and raised with computers. From a very young age I started creating digital content — videos, animations, and beyond — and that passion never stopped growing.

I work across **design, motion graphics, video, post-production, 3D, animation, videogames, websites, and apps**. I've always invested my free time in what I love most: creating ideas, experiences, and digital products. There's still a lot to learn, and a lot to build.
